      <h1>Reason Cafe</h1>
  <main>
    <p>
      Reason Cafe is a place to think about reason, reasonably - a place to elevate reason, critical
      thinking, and rationality over dogmas of every kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogma: Authoritative ideas accepted uncritically and (often) on insufficient evidence. Dogmas
      come from many places, including religion, politics, community standards, family, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason: The human ability to weigh evidence and think about what is true, what works, etc.
      Reason is often done best in community with people who will challenge each other.
    </p>
    <p>No one is free from dogma.</p>
    <p>Reason isn't everything, nor is it an infallible guide.</p>
    <p>
      But it is the best thing humans have. And it is way better than the irrationality in
      ascendency today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reason Cafe launches today, January 20, 2025 - a date which I fear will become known as a dark
      day for reason. Time will tell.
