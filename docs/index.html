        Be aware of this truth that the people on this earth could be joyous, if
        only they would live rationally, and if they would contribute mutually
        to each othersâ€™ welfare.<br />

        Reason Cafe is a place to think about reason, reasonably - a place to
        elevate reason, critical thinking, and rationality over dogmas of every
        kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dogma: Authoritative ideas accepted uncritically and (often) on
        insufficient evidence. Dogmas come from many places, including religion,
        politics, community standards, family, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reason: The human ability to weigh evidence and think about what is
        true, what works, etc. Reason is often done best in community with
        people who will challenge each other.
      </p>
      <p>No one is free from dogma.</p>
      <p>Reason isn't everything, nor is it an infallible guide.</p>
      <p>
        But it is the best thing humans have. And it is way better than the
        irrationality in ascendency today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reason Cafe launches today, January 20, 2025 - a date which I fear will
        become known as a dark day for reason. Time will tell.

        What troubles me most about my lovely country is that its children are
        seldom taught that American freedom will vanish, if, when they grow up,
        and in the exercise of their duties as citizens, they insist that our
        courts and policemen and prisons be guided by divine or natural law.<br />
